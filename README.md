\#\# Typesetting Lessig on *The Issues*

Being English, and living in Wales, 
I'm a bit remote to make any active contribution
to Larry Lessig's campaign for the 2016 US elections.

His ideas resonate deeply with my own thinking,
and I hope, one day, 
to see them re-used in UK politics
(which is almost as bad today as US politics).

So I thought it might be helpful to assemble 
his posts 
from [The Medium](https://medium.com/lessig-on-the-issues),
and typeset them beautifully (I hope!), 
to allow them to be published even wider.

I realise that in this case the message 
is much more important than the medium,
but I hope this addition helps, if only a little.

This is a derived work, 
based of the writings of Prof. Larry Lessig and others.
I hereby assign my rights in this work to Prof. Lessig, 
and licence it under the same conditions as the original.
